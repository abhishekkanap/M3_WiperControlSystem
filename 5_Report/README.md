# Wiper Control System

# ABSTRACT
A wiper is a vital component that cleans raindrops or any other liquid from the windscreen of a car. Previously, the wipers had to be activated manually by setting the frequency. The operation of increasing the wiper speed is modified as a result. The project's purpose is to improve the systems of older cars by providing automated transmissions. Wiping technology, to improve the system by including a sensor and actuator, and to develop a basic program that would work with the system completely. The structure The principle of this proposed wiper system is similar to that of other existing conventional wipers. Regardless of the fact that it drains water from the windscreen, this system will be updated to an automatic control system using a Peripheral Interface.

# INTRODUCTION :

The windshield wipers are used to remove water, snow, dust, and road spray from a vehicle's windscreen. The early windshield wipers were manually operated by moving a lever located inside the vehicle's interior. Later wiper designs were powered by the manifold vacuum generated by the engine. In today's world, virtually all wipers are powered by an electric motor connected to a linkage system, and they are controlled by a knob located next to the steering wheel. The driver has the ability to control the speed of the wiper blades.

Modern windshield wipers can also be operated on an as-needed basis. The intermittent wiper option, as opposed to the continuous wiper option, cycles the wipers on and off every few seconds rather than operating continuously. It was in the 1970s that intermittent control made its debut in autos. A steady power source was used to control the original intermittent wipers, which were routed through a series of switches to achieve their functionality. Most automobile wipers are now controlled by a microprocessor, which is becoming increasingly common.

Many wiper systems in cars today are controlled by a rain sensor, which measures the speed at which raindrops hit the windshield and activates the wipers. The inputs from the sensor are evaluated by a microprocessor, which then calculates the speed at which the wipers should travel.
    
# GENERAL WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN :

   Wiper Control System has separate on/off buttons for control. Generally, in case of automobiles there are 2 wipers, each of it performing synchronized action with respect to one another. The are functions for washing and heating.The intrevals for speed can be varied with the help of + and - buttons.
   The washing functions includes the spraying action followed by wiping and purging. Even though the wiper is put off during the middle of its operation, it completes it cycle by travelling back to the home position.
   
# STM32 BASED WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM :

   Our objective is to build a Wiper Control system using STM32 which is a 32-bit microcontroller IC.The wiper operation can be carried out with basic modes like On, speed change and Off. As STM32 contains only 1 push button, the same button is utilized for all operations.
   The discovery board contains 4 LEDs 
   * The RED LED is considered for the ACC position. Once the push button is pressed for 2 seconds, the RED LED keeps continuously glowing until the stop of the engine signifying the engine condition to be turned ON.
   * On press of the user input push button, the other three Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency. The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz.
   * The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts with the next press.
   * If the push button is pressed for 2 seconds continuously, the RED light goes off and the pattern stops bringing it to default position which signifies the engine is turned OFF.
   
   A wiper speed control system for an automobile wiper regulates the operating speed of a wiper in accordance with the amount of rain falling on the windshield. This is a very much essential component in each automobile as it avoids the risk of accidents during rainy conditions.

# WORKING PROCESS :

* The RED LED is considered for the ACC position. Once the push button is pressed for 2 seconds, the RED LED keeps continuously glowing until the stop of the engine signifying the engine condition to be turned ON.
* On press of the user input push button, the other three Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency. The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz.
* The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts with the next press.
* If the push button is pressed for 2 seconds continuously, the RED light goes off and the pattern stops bringing it to default position which signifies the engine is turned OFF.

# SWOT ANALYSIS :

## Strength

* The wiper comes back to default position even if stooped in the middle
* Safety for the driver as well as the passengers in the vehicle
* Clear Visibility to the Driver for neat ride.

## Weakness 
* The total cost of the wiper system is high if implemented in real-time.
* The major disadvantage is that STM32 contains only one button for all the operation
* User has to undergo a sequence to acquire desired result and can't attain his result directly with the press of the button.

## Opportunities
* Rain sensing and automatic operation can be implemented as further enhancement.

## Threats 
* Replacing the board is not possible if it malfunctions.
* Can't have more functions as the functionality of the board is very basic.

# 5W's AND 1H :
